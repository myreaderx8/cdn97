It\u2019s inspired by what the weekday <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/the-exchange\/\"><em>Exchange column<\/em><\/a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. <\/em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\"><em>here<\/em><\/a><em>. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Hello everyone, I hope you had a lovely week. I turned 32 after experiencing sleep-destroying heartburn. So, a little good and a little bad. But that didn\u2019t stop the markets. Nope. Not a bit. Which means we have a lot to talk about, including falling insurtech stocks and what the situation might mean for startups, and a raft of IPOs. This will be fun!<\/p>\n<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty of our chats with newly public companies Kaltura, Couchbase and Enovix, let\u2019s talk insurtech.<\/p>\n<p>In the last year or so we\u2019ve seen a number of insurtech startups go public, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/28\/3-lessons-from-roots-ipo-pricing\/\">including Root<\/a> (auto insurance), <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/03\/as-metromile-looks-to-go-public-insurtech-funding-is-on-the-rise\/\">Metromile<\/a> (car insurance), and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/02\/lemonade-and-accolade-open-sharply-higher-as-public-markets-rally\/\">Lemonade<\/a> (rental insurance). Here\u2019s a quick digest of how their performance looks today:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Root: $7.72 per share, 71.4% down from its $27 per share IPO price.<\/li>\n<li>Metromile: $7.26 per share, down 64.4% from its post-combination highs.<\/li>\n<li>Lemonade: $86.97 per share, up 199.9% from its IPO price of $29 per share.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Recall that Root and Metromile began to trade after Lemonade, so their declines are not over a longer time horizon, but a shorter interval. Which makes the situation all the more interesting.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s going on? Well, two of the three insurtech public offerings (SPACs, IPOs, etc.) are sharply underwater. That doesn\u2019t bode incredibly well for Hippo, which is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/05\/the-technology-selloff-is-getting-to-be-somewhat-material\/\">pursuing its own SPAC-led combination<\/a> that should be wrapping up in short order. The huge declines don\u2019t seem bullish for insurtech startups, who will have to answer private-market investor doubts concerning their value.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"QPYXmW8or5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/23\/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector\/\">China&#8217;s expected edtech clampdown may chill a key startup sector<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;China&#8217;s expected edtech clampdown may chill a key startup sector&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/23\/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector\/embed\/#?secret=QPYXmW8or5\" data-secret=\"QPYXmW8or5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Does Lemonade\u2019s strong post-IPO performance allay concerns? It\u2019s tricky. The company has been busy expanding into new markets, including auto insurance. The company did take a somewhat material hit from the Texas freeze earlier this year &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/s24.q4cdn.com\/139015699\/files\/doc_financials\/2021\/q1\/Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">per its most recent earnings report<\/a> &#8212; but past those two data points it\u2019s not entirely clear what the company is doing that the other two are not. But investors are stoked about Lemonade, and not Root and Metromile. Figuring out why that\u2019s the case, and why their startup is more Lemonade than the other two, is going to be key for the many insurtech startups still scaling toward their own IPOs.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s IPO season<\/h2>\n<p>The Exchange has been busy on the phones these last two weeks, talking to CEOs of companies going public to try and learn from their recent experiences. So, what follows are notes from calls with folks at Kaltura, Couchbase and Enovix. Enjoy!<\/p>\n<h3>Kaltura<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reminder: Online-video-focused Kaltura <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/01\/kaltura-files-to-go-public-on-the-back-of-accelerating-revenue-growth-rising-losses\/\">filed to go public earlier<\/a> this year before <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/01\/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing\/\">delaying its IPO<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/12\/q3-ipo-cycle-starts-strong-with-couchbase-pricing-and-kaltura-relisting\/\">taking another run at the funding event.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>The Exchange spoke with Kaltura CEO Ron Yekutiel, who said that the company\u2019s IPO\u2019s timing was impacted by the early-2021 public market turmoil. That was not a surprise, but it was good to get confirmation regardless.<\/li>\n<li>That freeze was partially caused by the Archegos implosion, per Yekutiel. That makes sense, but was news to us.<\/li>\n<li>Yekutiel said that his company wasn\u2019t thrilled about the delay &#8212; going public is the only fundraise that you pre-announce, he noted &#8212; but added that investors his company had already spoken to the first-time around were still enthused about Kaltura on its second run at an IPO.<\/li>\n<li>Per the CEO, Kaltura\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/12\/q3-ipo-cycle-starts-strong-with-couchbase-pricing-and-kaltura-relisting\/\">preliminary Q2 results<\/a> showed investors that what it was talking about earlier in the year was coming true. He also stressed uptake in new products as key to the company\u2019s continued growth.<\/li>\n<li>The CEO was happy with how his company priced and traded during its first day, snagging a flat 20% uptick in value upon trading. He noted that more would have been excessive, and less would have been un-good.<\/li>\n<li>Regarding the lower valuation that Kaltura priced at compared to its March-era IPO price range, Yekutiel said that you don\u2019t get a third chance to make a first impression and that his company wanted to get the offering done. So they did. Points for not getting lost in their own head.<\/li>\n<li>Kaltura is up 17.5% from its $10 per-share IPO price as of the time of writing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One anecdote, if I may. Kaltura won an early TechCrunch40 &#8212; the precursor to the TechCrunch50 event, itself a predecessor to today\u2019s TechCrunch Disrupt conference series &#8212; thanks to a single vote cast via physical token. Yekutiel still has that token, and showed it to us during our chat. Neat!<\/p>\n<h3>Couchbase<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Exchange spoke with noSQL database company Couchbase\u2019s CEO Matt Cain. Couchbase priced at $24 per share, above its $20 to $23 per-share IPO price range.<\/li>\n<li>Today it\u2019s worth $33.20, rising 9.2% in today\u2019s trading as of the time of writing.<\/li>\n<li>Cain was talking from a pretty strict script &#8212; a pretty standard situation amongst newly public CEOs worried about fucking up and going to jail &#8212; so we didn\u2019t get the precise answers we were looking for. But we still managed to learn a few things, including that Couchbase was yet another company that found the meeting density made possible by remote roadshows to be accretive.<\/li>\n<li>The CEO was focused on discussing the scale of the opportunity ahead of Couchbase, namely the world of operational databases. It\u2019s hard to find a bigger market, he argued, which made investors excited about what his company might be able to accomplish. Our read here is that there\u2019s probably plenty of surface area for startups in the database world, if the market is as big as Cain reckons it is.<\/li>\n<li>We wanted to learn a bit more about how public-market investors view open-source powered companies, but didn\u2019t get too much from him on the matter. Still, the company\u2019s IPO is a pretty damn strong one, implying that being OSS-built isn\u2019t exactly a detriment to a company hoping to exit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cAa2PHDexw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/26\/2170552\/\">Everyone wants to invest in open-source startups now<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Everyone wants to invest in open-source startups now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/26\/2170552\/embed\/#?secret=cAa2PHDexw\" data-secret=\"cAa2PHDexw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3>Enovix<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Exchange wanted to chat with newly public company Enovix because it debuted via a SPAC. Why does that matter? Because there are other battery-focused companies looking to go public via SPACs. So, the chat was good background for later work.<\/li>\n<li>And we love talking to public companies. Who doesn\u2019t?<\/li>\n<li>Asked if combination-and-trade-under-new-ticker-symbol day was like an IPO to his firm, Rust said that it was. Fair enough.<\/li>\n<li>The company\u2019s combination date for its SPAC slipped from Q2 to Q3, we noticed. Why was that? Some SEC changes regarding accounting, in short. Not a big deal was our impression from the chat, but one that did cause a slight delay to Enovix\u2019s trading date.<\/li>\n<li>Why go public via a SPAC? Cash, but also the particular sponsor of their combination, which Rust said was a key resource in terms of operational knowledge. The company has also hired from its SPAC sponsor\u2019s network, which felt notable. (Hey look, actual investor value-add!)<\/li>\n<li>Asked why his company is worth less than the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autonews.com\/suppliers\/battery-supplier-ses-takes-spac-path-capital-deal-values-company-36b\">impending SES SPAC<\/a>, another battery company that has yet to generate revenue, Rust said that the value of his company in its SPAC deal was a negotiation, and that if the company is successful, whether it was valued at $1.1 billion or $1.4 billion wouldn\u2019t really matter.<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s fun about Enovix is that it is not starting with its impending battery tech aimed at EVs. Instead, it\u2019s targeting high-end electronics. Why? Quick cycles to get batteries into hardware and possible pricing power. It does intend to get into EVs in time, however.<\/li>\n<li>The company is worth $17.33 per share, giving it what Yahoo Finance describes as a $2.5 billion valuation. That\u2019s a good markup from what it expected and could bode well for SES\u2019s own, future debut.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Yo, that was a <em>lot<\/em>. Thanks for sticking with me.

Mike Vernal outlines how to design feedback loops in the search for product-market fit"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Sequoia&#8217;s Mike Vernal<\/span> has worn many hats. He was VP of product and engineering at Facebook for eight years before getting into investment. His portfolio includes Houseparty, Threads, Canvas, Citizen, PicsArt and more, and he continues to invest in companies across a broad spectrum of stages and verticals, including consumer, enterprise, marketplaces, fintech and more.<\/p>\n<p>Vernal joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising earlier this month to discuss how founders should think about product-market fit, with a specific focus on tempo. He covered how to organize around the pace of iteration, how to design with customer feedback loops in mind and how Sequoia evaluates companies with regard to tempo.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tBe explicit and be greedy at every single step along the way about getting feedback.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<h2>What is tempo?<\/h2>\n<p>Vernal breaks down tempo into two separate ingredients: speed and consistency.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just about going fast (which can often lead to some recklessness). It&#8217;s about setting a pace and staying consistent with that pace.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the very best compliments an angel can bestow on a founding team and include in an introduction to us is, &#8220;They&#8217;re just really fast,&#8221; or &#8220;She&#8217;s a machine.&#8221; What does that mean? It doesn&#8217;t mean fast in the kind of uncontrolled, reckless, crashing sense. It means fast in a sort of consistent, maniacal, get-a-little-bit-better-each-day kind of way. And it&#8217;s actually one of the top things that we look for, at least when evaluating a team: how consistently fast they move. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 2:26)<\/strong><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Vernal went on to say that tempo is directly correlated to goals and objectives and key results (OKRs). Building a feedback loop into those OKRs and determining the tempo with which to attack them is critical, especially during the process of finding product-market fit.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Finding product-market fit is not a deterministic process. Most of the time, it requires iteration. It requires constant adaptation. My mental model is that it&#8217;s actually just a turn-based game with an unknown number of steps, and sometimes either the clock or the money or both run out before you get to finish the game. It&#8217;s kind of like a game of chess. So what is your optimal strategy? <em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:25)<\/strong><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Feedback is your friend<\/h2>\n<p>As Vernal explained, finding product-market fit is all about feedback, and that must be an ongoing, built-in part of the process.

Roundup: Kai-Fu Lee&#8217;s first Europe bet, WeRide buys a truck startup"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Hello and welcome back to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/china-roundup\/\">TechCrunch\u2019s China Roundup<\/a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the geopolitical headwinds for foreign tech firms to enter China, many companies, especially those that find a dependable partner, are still forging ahead. For this week&#8217;s roundup, I&#8217;m including a conversation I had with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prophesee.ai\/\">Prophesee<\/a>, a French vision technology startup, which recently got funding from Kai-Fu Lee and Xiaomi, along with the usual news digest.<\/p>\n<h2>Spotting opportunities in China<\/h2>\n<p>Like many companies working on futuristic, cutting-edge tech in Europe, Prophesee was a spinout from university research labs. Previously, I covered two such companies from Sweden: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/26\/imint-vidhance-profile\/\">Imint<\/a>, which improves smartphone video production through deep learning, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/10\/dirac-profile\/\">Dirac<\/a>, an expert in sound optimization.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The three companies have two things in common: They are all in niche fields, and they have all found eager customers in China.<\/p>\n<p>For Prophesee, they are production lines, automakers and smartphone companies in China looking for breakthroughs in perception technology, which will in turn improve how their robots respond to the environment. So it&#8217;s unsurprising that Xiaomi and Chinese chip-focused investment firm Inno-Chip backed Prophesee in its latest funding round, which was led by Sinovation Venture.<\/p>\n<p>The funding size was undisclosed but TechCrunch learned it was in the range of &#8220;tens of million USD.&#8221; It was also the first investment that Kai-Fu Lee has made through Sinovation in Europe. As Prophesee CEO Luca Verre recalled:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I met Dr. Kai-Fu Lee three years ago during the World Economic Forum \u2026 and when I pitched to him about Prophesee, he got very intrigued. And then over the past three years, actually, we kept in touch and last year, given the growing traction we were having in China, particularly in the mobile and IoT industry, he decided to jump in. He said okay, it is now the right timing Prophesee becomes big.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Paris-based company wasn&#8217;t actively seeking funding, but it believed having Chinese strategic investors could help it gain greater access to the complex market.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than sending information collected by sensors and cameras to computing platforms, Prophesee fits that process inside a chip (fabricated by Sony) that mimics the human eyes, a technology that is built upon neuromorphic engineering.<\/p>\n<p>The old method snaps a collection of fixed images so when information grows in volume, a tremendous amount of computing power is needed. In contrast, Prophesee&#8217;s sensors, which it describes as &#8220;event-based,&#8221; only pick up changes in the environment just as the photoreceptors in our eyes and can process information continuously and quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Europe has been pioneering neuromorphic computing, but in recent years, Verre saw a surge in research coming from Chinese universities and tech firms, which reaffirmed his confidence in the market&#8217;s appetite.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We see Chinese OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), particularly Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo pushing the standard of quality of image quality to very, very high \u2026 They are very eager to adopt new technology to further differentiate in a way which is faster and more aggressive than Apple. Apple is a company with an attitude which to me looks more similar to Huawei. So maybe for some technology, it takes more time to see the technology mature and adopt, which is right very often but later. So I&#8217;m sure that Apple will come at certain point with some products integrating event-based technology. In fact, we see them moving. We see them filing patents in the space. I&#8217;m sure that will come, but maybe not the first.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Though China is striving for technological independence, Verre believed Prophesee&#8217;s addressable market is large enough &#8212; $20 billion by his estimate. Nonetheless, he admitted he&#8217;d be &#8220;naive to believe Prophesee will be the only one to capture&#8221; this opportunity.<\/p>\n<h2>WeRide bought a truck company<\/h2>\n<p>One of China&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/22\/weride-310-million-series-c\/\"> most valuable robotaxi startups<\/a> has just acquired an autonomous trucking company called MoonX. The size of the deal is undisclosed, but we know that MoonX raised &#8220;tens of millions RMB&#8221; 15 months ago in a Series A round.<\/p>\n<p>While WeRide is focused on Level 4 self-driving technology, it is also finding new monetization avenues before its robotaxis can chauffeur people at scale. It&#8217;s done so by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weride.ai\/en\/mini-robobus-en\/\">developing minibusses<\/a>, and the MoonX acqui-hire, which brings the company&#8217;s founder and over 50 engineers to WeRide, will likely help diversify its revenue pool.<\/p>\n<p>WeRide and MoonX have deep-rooted relationships. Their respective founders, Tony Han and Yang Qingxiong, worked side by side at Jingchi, which was later rebranded to WeRide.\u00a0Han co-founded Jingchi and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.qimingventures.com\/en\/node\/2889\"> took the helm as CEO <\/a>in March 2018 while Yang was assigned vice president of engineering. But Yang soon quit and started MoonX.<\/p>\n<p>Han, a Baidu veteran, gave Yang a warm homecoming and put him in charge of the firm&#8217;s research institute and its new office in Shenzhen, home to MoonX. WeRide&#8217;s sprawling headquarters is just about an hour&#8217;s drive away in the adjacent city of Guangzhou.<\/p>\n<h2>AI surveillance giant Cloudwalk nears IPO<\/h2>\n<p>Cloudwalk belongs to a cohort of Chinese unicorns that flourished through the second half of the 2010s by selling computer vision technology to government agencies across China. Together, Cloudwalk and its rivals SenseTime, Megvii and Yitu were dubbed the &#8220;four AI dragons&#8221; for their fast ascending valuations and handsome funding rounds.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the term &#8220;AI dragon&#8221; is now a misnomer as AI application becomes so pervasive across industries. Investors soon realized these upstarts need to diversify revenue streams beyond smart city contracts, and they&#8217;ve been waiting anxiously for exits. Finally, here comes Cloudwalk, which will likely be the first in its cohort to go public.<\/p>\n<p>Cloudwalk&#8217;s application to raise 3.75 billion yuan ($580 million) from an IPO on the Shanghai STAR board was approved this week, though it can still be months before it starts trading. The firm&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/zqpdf.stcn.com\/kcb\/2020-12-03\/sbg\/7006bc6a4db241968762f823b292d0ca.pdf\">financials<\/a> don&#8217;t look particularly rosy for investors, with net loss amounting to 720 million yuan in 2020.<\/p>\n<h2>Also in the news<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Speaking of the torrent of news in autonomous driving, vehicle vision provider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.calmcar.com\/about.html\">CalmCar<\/a> said this week that it <strong>has <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/mp.weixin.qq.com\/s\/uRh3WkllEPrI8hOGSrYowg\">raised $150 million<\/a> <strong>in a Series C round. <\/strong>Founded by several overseas Chinese returnees in 2016, CalmCar uses deep learning to develop ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) used in automotive, industrial and surveillance scenarios. German auto parts maker ZF led the round.<\/li>\n<li>Baby clothes direct-to-consumer brand <strong style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">PatPat said it has raised $510 million from Series C and D rounds. <\/strong>The D2C ecosystem leveraging China&#8217;s robust supply chains is increasingly gaining interest from venture capitalists. Brands like Shein, PatPat, Cider and Outer have all secured fundings from established VCs. Founded by three Carnegie Mellon grads, PatPat counts IDG Capital, General Atlantic, DST Global, GGV Capital, SIG China and Sequoia China among its investors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"f1A2KqHW5t\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/22\/why-amazon-should-pay-attention-to-shein\/\">Why Amazon should pay attention to Shein<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why Amazon should pay attention to Shein&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/22\/why-amazon-should-pay-attention-to-shein\/embed\/#?secret=f1A2KqHW5t\" data-secret=\"f1A2KqHW5t\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hello and welcome back to\u00a0TechCrunch\u2019s China Roundup, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.

become the hot must-have deal for automakers that have set ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no longer just about securing a supply of cells. The string of partnerships and joint ventures show that automakers are taking a more active role in the development and even production of battery cells.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tAutomakers are taking a more active role in the development and even production of battery cells.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>And the deals don&#8217;t appear to be slowing down. Just this week, Mercedes-Benz announced its $47 billion plan to become an electric-only automaker by 2030. Securing its battery supply chain by expanding existing partnerships or locking in new ones to jointly develop and produce battery cells and modules is a critical piece of its plan.<\/p>\n<p>Mercedes, like other automakers, is also focused on developing and deploying advanced battery technology. In addition to setting up eight new battery plants to supply its future EVs, the German automaker said it was partnering with Sila Nano, the Silicon Valley battery chemistry startup that it has previously invested in, to increase energy density, which should in turn improve range and allow for shorter charging times.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis follows a trend that we&#8217;ve seen of automakers realizing how critical the battery is and taking more control of the production of the cells in order to ensure their own supply,\u201d Sila Nano CEO Gene Berdichevsky said in a recent interview. \u201cLike if you&#8217;re VW, and you say, &#8216;We&#8217;re going to go 50% electric by whatever year,&#8217; but then the batteries don&#8217;t show up, you&#8217;re bankrupt, you&#8217;re dead. Their scale is so big that even if their cell partners have promised them to deliver, automakers are scared that they won&#8217;t.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tesla, BMW and Volkswagen were early adopters of the battery joint-venture strategy. In 2014,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tesla.com\/blog\/panasonic-and-tesla-sign-agreement-gigafactory\">Tesla and Panasonic signed an agreement to build a large battery manufacturing plant<\/a>, or a gigafactory as everyone is now calling it, in the U.S. and have worked together since.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.motorauthority.com\/news\/1114390_bmw-partners-with-us-solid-state-battery-company\"> BMW began working with Solid Power<\/a> in 2017 to create solid-state batteries for high-performance EVs that could potentially lower costs by requiring less safety features than lithium-ion batteries.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to its partnership with Northvolt, VW is also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/autos-transportation\/volkswagen-seeks-partnerships-battery-materials-race-2021-06-15\/\">in talks with suppliers<\/a> to secure more direct access to supplies like semiconductors and lithium so it can keep its existing plants running at full speed.<\/p>\n<p>Now the rest of the industry is moving to work <em>with<\/em> battery companies, to share knowledge and resources and essentially become the manufacturer.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Battery joint ventures have become the

It\u2019s inspired by what the weekday <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/the-exchange\/\"><em>Exchange column<\/em><\/a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. <\/em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\"><em>here<\/em><\/a><em>. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Hello everyone, I hope you had a lovely week. I turned 32 after experiencing sleep-destroying heartburn. So, a little good and a little bad. But that didn\u2019t stop the markets. Nope. Not a bit. Which means we have a lot to talk about, including falling insurtech stocks and what the situation might mean for startups, and a raft of IPOs. This will be fun!<\/p>\n<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty of our chats with newly public companies Kaltura, Couchbase and Enovix, let\u2019s talk insurtech.<\/p>\n<p>In the last year or so we\u2019ve seen a number of insurtech startups go public, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/28\/3-lessons-from-roots-ipo-pricing\/\">including Root<\/a> (auto insurance), <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/03\/as-metromile-looks-to-go-public-insurtech-funding-is-on-the-rise\/\">Metromile<\/a> (car insurance), and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/02\/lemonade-and-accolade-open-sharply-higher-as-public-markets-rally\/\">Lemonade<\/a> (rental insurance). Here\u2019s a quick digest of how their performance looks today:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Root: $7.72 per share, 71.4% down from its $27 per share IPO price.<\/li>\n<li>Metromile: $7.26 per share, down 64.4% from its post-combination highs.<\/li>\n<li>Lemonade: $86.97 per share, up 199.9% from its IPO price of $29 per share.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Recall that Root and Metromile began to trade after Lemonade, so their declines are not over a longer time horizon, but a shorter interval. Which makes the situation all the more interesting.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s going on? Well, two of the three insurtech public offerings (SPACs, IPOs, etc.) are sharply underwater. That doesn\u2019t bode incredibly well for Hippo, which is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/05\/the-technology-selloff-is-getting-to-be-somewhat-material\/\">pursuing its own SPAC-led combination<\/a> that should be wrapping up in short order. The huge declines don\u2019t seem bullish for insurtech startups, who will have to answer private-market investor doubts concerning their value.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"QPYXmW8or5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/23\/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector\/\">China&#8217;s expected edtech clampdown may chill a key startup sector<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;China&#8217;s expected edtech clampdown may chill a key startup sector&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/23\/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector\/embed\/#?secret=QPYXmW8or5\" data-secret=\"QPYXmW8or5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Does Lemonade\u2019s strong post-IPO performance allay concerns? It\u2019s tricky. The company has been busy expanding into new markets, including auto insurance. The company did take a somewhat material hit from the Texas freeze earlier this year &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/s24.q4cdn.com\/139015699\/files\/doc_financials\/2021\/q1\/Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">per its most recent earnings report<\/a> &#8212; but past those two data points it\u2019s not entirely clear what the company is doing that the other two are not. But investors are stoked about Lemonade, and not Root and Metromile. Figuring out why that\u2019s the case, and why their startup is more Lemonade than the other two, is going to be key for the many insurtech startups still scaling toward their own IPOs.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s IPO season<\/h2>\n<p>The Exchange has been busy on the phones these last two weeks, talking to CEOs of companies going public to try and learn from their recent experiences. So, what follows are notes from calls with folks at Kaltura, Couchbase and Enovix. Enjoy!<\/p>\n<h3>Kaltura<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reminder: Online-video-focused Kaltura <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/01\/kaltura-files-to-go-public-on-the-back-of-accelerating-revenue-growth-rising-losses\/\">filed to go public earlier<\/a> this year before <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/01\/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing\/\">delaying its IPO<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/12\/q3-ipo-cycle-starts-strong-with-couchbase-pricing-and-kaltura-relisting\/\">taking another run at the funding event.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>The Exchange spoke with Kaltura CEO Ron Yekutiel, who said that the company\u2019s IPO\u2019s timing was impacted by the early-2021 public market turmoil. That was not a surprise, but it was good to get confirmation regardless.<\/li>\n<li>That freeze was partially caused by the Archegos implosion, per Yekutiel. That makes sense, but was news to us.<\/li>\n<li>Yekutiel said that his company wasn\u2019t thrilled about the delay &#8212; going public is the only fundraise that you pre-announce, he noted &#8212; but added that investors his company had already spoken to the first-time around were still enthused about Kaltura on its second run at an IPO.<\/li>\n<li>Per the CEO, Kaltura\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/12\/q3-ipo-cycle-starts-strong-with-couchbase-pricing-and-kaltura-relisting\/\">preliminary Q2 results<\/a> showed investors that what it was talking about earlier in the year was coming true. He also stressed uptake in new products as key to the company\u2019s continued growth.<\/li>\n<li>The CEO was happy with how his company priced and traded during its first day, snagging a flat 20% uptick in value upon trading. He noted that more would have been excessive, and less would have been un-good.<\/li>\n<li>Regarding the lower valuation that Kaltura priced at compared to its March-era IPO price range, Yekutiel said that you don\u2019t get a third chance to make a first impression and that his company wanted to get the offering done. So they did. Points for not getting lost in their own head.<\/li>\n<li>Kaltura is up 17.5% from its $10 per-share IPO price as of the time of writing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One anecdote, if I may. Kaltura won an early TechCrunch40 &#8212; the precursor to the TechCrunch50 event, itself a predecessor to today\u2019s TechCrunch Disrupt conference series &#8212; thanks to a single vote cast via physical token. Yekutiel still has that token, and showed it to us during our chat. Neat!<\/p>\n<h3>Couchbase<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Exchange spoke with noSQL database company Couchbase\u2019s CEO Matt Cain. Couchbase priced at $24 per share, above its $20 to $23 per-share IPO price range.<\/li>\n<li>Today it\u2019s worth $33.20, rising 9.2% in today\u2019s trading as of the time of writing.<\/li>\n<li>Cain was talking from a pretty strict script &#8212; a pretty standard situation amongst newly public CEOs worried about fucking up and going to jail &#8212; so we didn\u2019t get the precise answers we were looking for. But we still managed to learn a few things, including that Couchbase was yet another company that found the meeting density made possible by remote roadshows to be accretive.<\/li>\n<li>The CEO was focused on discussing the scale of the opportunity ahead of Couchbase, namely the world of operational databases. It\u2019s hard to find a bigger market, he argued, which made investors excited about what his company might be able to accomplish. Our read here is that there\u2019s probably plenty of surface area for startups in the database world, if the market is as big as Cain reckons it is.<\/li>\n<li>We wanted to learn a bit more about how public-market investors view open-source powered companies, but didn\u2019t get too much from him on the matter. Still, the company\u2019s IPO is a pretty damn strong one, implying that being OSS-built isn\u2019t exactly a detriment to a company hoping to exit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cAa2PHDexw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/26\/2170552\/\">Everyone wants to invest in open-source startups now<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Everyone wants to invest in open-source startups now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/26\/2170552\/embed\/#?secret=cAa2PHDexw\" data-secret=\"cAa2PHDexw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3>Enovix<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Exchange wanted to chat with newly public company Enovix because it debuted via a SPAC. Why does that matter? Because there are other battery-focused companies looking to go public via SPACs. So, the chat was good background for later work.<\/li>\n<li>And we love talking to public companies. Who doesn\u2019t?<\/li>\n<li>Asked if combination-and-trade-under-new-ticker-symbol day was like an IPO to his firm, Rust said that it was. Fair enough.<\/li>\n<li>The company\u2019s combination date for its SPAC slipped from Q2 to Q3, we noticed. Why was that? Some SEC changes regarding accounting, in short. Not a big deal was our impression from the chat, but one that did cause a slight delay to Enovix\u2019s trading date.<\/li>\n<li>Why go public via a SPAC? Cash, but also the particular sponsor of their combination, which Rust said was a key resource in terms of operational knowledge. The company has also hired from its SPAC sponsor\u2019s network, which felt notable. (Hey look, actual investor value-add!)<\/li>\n<li>Asked why his company is worth less than the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autonews.com\/suppliers\/battery-supplier-ses-takes-spac-path-capital-deal-values-company-36b\">impending SES SPAC<\/a>, another battery company that has yet to generate revenue, Rust said that the value of his company in its SPAC deal was a negotiation, and that if the company is successful, whether it was valued at $1.1 billion or $1.4 billion wouldn\u2019t really matter.<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s fun about Enovix is that it is not starting with its impending battery tech aimed at EVs. Instead, it\u2019s targeting high-end electronics. Why? Quick cycles to get batteries into hardware and possible pricing power. It does intend to get into EVs in time, however.<\/li>\n<li>The company is worth $17.33 per share, giving it what Yahoo Finance describes as a $2.5 billion valuation. That\u2019s a good markup from what it expected and could bode well for SES\u2019s own, future debut.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Yo, that was a <em>lot<\/em>. Thanks for sticking with me.

Roundup: Kai-Fu Lee&#8217;s first Europe bet, WeRide buys a truck startup"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Hello and welcome back to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/china-roundup\/\">TechCrunch\u2019s China Roundup<\/a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the geopolitical headwinds for foreign tech firms to enter China, many companies, especially those that find a dependable partner, are still forging ahead. For this week&#8217;s roundup, I&#8217;m including a conversation I had with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prophesee.ai\/\">Prophesee<\/a>, a French vision technology startup, which recently got funding from Kai-Fu Lee and Xiaomi, along with the usual news digest.<\/p>\n<h2>Spotting opportunities in China<\/h2>\n<p>Like many companies working on futuristic, cutting-edge tech in Europe, Prophesee was a spinout from university research labs. Previously, I covered two such companies from Sweden: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/26\/imint-vidhance-profile\/\">Imint<\/a>, which improves smartphone video production through deep learning, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/10\/dirac-profile\/\">Dirac<\/a>, an expert in sound optimization.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The three companies have two things in common: They are all in niche fields, and they have all found eager customers in China.<\/p>\n<p>For Prophesee, they are production lines, automakers and smartphone companies in China looking for breakthroughs in perception technology, which will in turn improve how their robots respond to the environment. So it&#8217;s unsurprising that Xiaomi and Chinese chip-focused investment firm Inno-Chip backed Prophesee in its latest funding round, which was led by Sinovation Venture.<\/p>\n<p>The funding size was undisclosed but TechCrunch learned it was in the range of &#8220;tens of million USD.&#8221; It was also the first investment that Kai-Fu Lee has made through Sinovation in Europe. As Prophesee CEO Luca Verre recalled:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I met Dr. Kai-Fu Lee three years ago during the World Economic Forum \u2026 and when I pitched to him about Prophesee, he got very intrigued. And then over the past three years, actually, we kept in touch and last year, given the growing traction we were having in China, particularly in the mobile and IoT industry, he decided to jump in. He said okay, it is now the right timing Prophesee becomes big.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Paris-based company wasn&#8217;t actively seeking funding, but it believed having Chinese strategic investors could help it gain greater access to the complex market.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than sending information collected by sensors and cameras to computing platforms, Prophesee fits that process inside a chip (fabricated by Sony) that mimics the human eyes, a technology that is built upon neuromorphic engineering.<\/p>\n<p>The old method snaps a collection of fixed images so when information grows in volume, a tremendous amount of computing power is needed. In contrast, Prophesee&#8217;s sensors, which it describes as &#8220;event-based,&#8221; only pick up changes in the environment just as the photoreceptors in our eyes and can process information continuously and quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Europe has been pioneering neuromorphic computing, but in recent years, Verre saw a surge in research coming from Chinese universities and tech firms, which reaffirmed his confidence in the market&#8217;s appetite.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We see Chinese OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), particularly Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo pushing the standard of quality of image quality to very, very high \u2026 They are very eager to adopt new technology to further differentiate in a way which is faster and more aggressive than Apple. Apple is a company with an attitude which to me looks more similar to Huawei. So maybe for some technology, it takes more time to see the technology mature and adopt, which is right very often but later. So I&#8217;m sure that Apple will come at certain point with some products integrating event-based technology. In fact, we see them moving. We see them filing patents in the space. I&#8217;m sure that will come, but maybe not the first.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Though China is striving for technological independence, Verre believed Prophesee&#8217;s addressable market is large enough &#8212; $20 billion by his estimate. Nonetheless, he admitted he&#8217;d be &#8220;naive to believe Prophesee will be the only one to capture&#8221; this opportunity.<\/p>\n<h2>WeRide bought a truck company<\/h2>\n<p>One of China&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/22\/weride-310-million-series-c\/\"> most valuable robotaxi startups<\/a> has just acquired an autonomous trucking company called MoonX. The size of the deal is undisclosed, but we know that MoonX raised &#8220;tens of millions RMB&#8221; 15 months ago in a Series A round.<\/p>\n<p>While WeRide is focused on Level 4 self-driving technology, it is also finding new monetization avenues before its robotaxis can chauffeur people at scale. It&#8217;s done so by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weride.ai\/en\/mini-robobus-en\/\">developing minibusses<\/a>, and the MoonX acqui-hire, which brings the company&#8217;s founder and over 50 engineers to WeRide, will likely help diversify its revenue pool.<\/p>\n<p>WeRide and MoonX have deep-rooted relationships. Their respective founders, Tony Han and Yang Qingxiong, worked side by side at Jingchi, which was later rebranded to WeRide.\u00a0Han co-founded Jingchi and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.qimingventures.com\/en\/node\/2889\"> took the helm as CEO <\/a>in March 2018 while Yang was assigned vice president of engineering. But Yang soon quit and started MoonX.<\/p>\n<p>Han, a Baidu veteran, gave Yang a warm homecoming and put him in charge of the firm&#8217;s research institute and its new office in Shenzhen, home to MoonX. WeRide&#8217;s sprawling headquarters is just about an hour&#8217;s drive away in the adjacent city of Guangzhou.<\/p>\n<h2>AI surveillance giant Cloudwalk nears IPO<\/h2>\n<p>Cloudwalk belongs to a cohort of Chinese unicorns that flourished through the second half of the 2010s by selling computer vision technology to government agencies across China. Together, Cloudwalk and its rivals SenseTime, Megvii and Yitu were dubbed the &#8220;four AI dragons&#8221; for their fast ascending valuations and handsome funding rounds.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the term &#8220;AI dragon&#8221; is now a misnomer as AI application becomes so pervasive across industries. Investors soon realized these upstarts need to diversify revenue streams beyond smart city contracts, and they&#8217;ve been waiting anxiously for exits. Finally, here comes Cloudwalk, which will likely be the first in its cohort to go public.<\/p>\n<p>Cloudwalk&#8217;s application to raise 3.75 billion yuan ($580 million) from an IPO on the Shanghai STAR board was approved this week, though it can still be months before it starts trading. The firm&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/zqpdf.stcn.com\/kcb\/2020-12-03\/sbg\/7006bc6a4db241968762f823b292d0ca.pdf\">financials<\/a> don&#8217;t look particularly rosy for investors, with net loss amounting to 720 million yuan in 2020.<\/p>\n<h2>Also in the news<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Speaking of the torrent of news in autonomous driving, vehicle vision provider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.calmcar.com\/about.html\">CalmCar<\/a> said this week that it <strong>has <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/mp.weixin.qq.com\/s\/uRh3WkllEPrI8hOGSrYowg\">raised $150 million<\/a> <strong>in a Series C round. <\/strong>Founded by several overseas Chinese returnees in 2016, CalmCar uses deep learning to develop ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) used in automotive, industrial and surveillance scenarios. German auto parts maker ZF led the round.<\/li>\n<li>Baby clothes direct-to-consumer brand <strong style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">PatPat said it has raised $510 million from Series C and D rounds. <\/strong>The D2C ecosystem leveraging China&#8217;s robust supply chains is increasingly gaining interest from venture capitalists. Brands like Shein, PatPat, Cider and Outer have all secured fundings from established VCs. Founded by three Carnegie Mellon grads, PatPat counts IDG Capital, General Atlantic, DST Global, GGV Capital, SIG China and Sequoia China among its investors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"f1A2KqHW5t\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/22\/why-amazon-should-pay-attention-to-shein\/\">Why Amazon should pay attention to Shein<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why Amazon should pay attention to Shein&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/22\/why-amazon-should-pay-attention-to-shein\/embed\/#?secret=f1A2KqHW5t\" data-secret=\"f1A2KqHW5t\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hello and welcome back to\u00a0TechCrunch\u2019s China Roundup, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.

Mike Vernal outlines how to design feedback loops in the search for product-market fit"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Sequoia&#8217;s Mike Vernal<\/span> has worn many hats. He was VP of product and engineering at Facebook for eight years before getting into investment. His portfolio includes Houseparty, Threads, Canvas, Citizen, PicsArt and more, and he continues to invest in companies across a broad spectrum of stages and verticals, including consumer, enterprise, marketplaces, fintech and more.<\/p>\n<p>Vernal joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising earlier this month to discuss how founders should think about product-market fit, with a specific focus on tempo. He covered how to organize around the pace of iteration, how to design with customer feedback loops in mind and how Sequoia evaluates companies with regard to tempo.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tBe explicit and be greedy at every single step along the way about getting feedback.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<h2>What is tempo?<\/h2>\n<p>Vernal breaks down tempo into two separate ingredients: speed and consistency.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just about going fast (which can often lead to some recklessness). It&#8217;s about setting a pace and staying consistent with that pace.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the very best compliments an angel can bestow on a founding team and include in an introduction to us is, &#8220;They&#8217;re just really fast,&#8221; or &#8220;She&#8217;s a machine.&#8221; What does that mean? It doesn&#8217;t mean fast in the kind of uncontrolled, reckless, crashing sense. It means fast in a sort of consistent, maniacal, get-a-little-bit-better-each-day kind of way. And it&#8217;s actually one of the top things that we look for, at least when evaluating a team: how consistently fast they move. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 2:26)<\/strong><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Vernal went on to say that tempo is directly correlated to goals and objectives and key results (OKRs). Building a feedback loop into those OKRs and determining the tempo with which to attack them is critical, especially during the process of finding product-market fit.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Finding product-market fit is not a deterministic process. Most of the time, it requires iteration. It requires constant adaptation. My mental model is that it&#8217;s actually just a turn-based game with an unknown number of steps, and sometimes either the clock or the money or both run out before you get to finish the game. It&#8217;s kind of like a game of chess. So what is your optimal strategy? <em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:25)<\/strong><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Feedback is your friend<\/h2>\n<p>As Vernal explained, finding product-market fit is all about feedback, and that must be an ongoing, built-in part of the process. He outlined how founders can go about designing with that in mind.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Finding product-market fit is not a deterministic process.

become the hot must-have deal for automakers that have set ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no longer just about securing a supply of cells. The string of partnerships and joint ventures show that automakers are taking a more active role in the development and even production of battery cells.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tAutomakers are taking a more active role in the development and even production of battery cells.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>And the deals don&#8217;t appear to be slowing down. Just this week, Mercedes-Benz announced its $47 billion plan to become an electric-only automaker by 2030. Securing its battery supply chain by expanding existing partnerships or locking in new ones to jointly develop and produce battery cells and modules is a critical piece of its plan.<\/p>\n<p>Mercedes, like other automakers, is also focused on developing and deploying advanced battery technology. In addition to setting up eight new battery plants to supply its future EVs, the German automaker said it was partnering with Sila Nano, the Silicon Valley battery chemistry startup that it has previously invested in, to increase energy density, which should in turn improve range and allow for shorter charging times.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis follows a trend that we&#8217;ve seen of automakers realizing how critical the battery is and taking more control of the production of the cells in order to ensure their own supply,\u201d Sila Nano CEO Gene Berdichevsky said in a recent interview. \u201cLike if you&#8217;re VW, and you say, &#8216;We&#8217;re going to go 50% electric by whatever year,&#8217; but then the batteries don&#8217;t show up, you&#8217;re bankrupt, you&#8217;re dead. Their scale is so big that even if their cell partners have promised them to deliver, automakers are scared that they won&#8217;t.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tesla, BMW and Volkswagen were early adopters of the battery joint-venture strategy. In 2014,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tesla.com\/blog\/panasonic-and-tesla-sign-agreement-gigafactory\">Tesla and Panasonic signed an agreement to build a large battery manufacturing plant<\/a>, or a gigafactory as everyone is now calling it, in the U.S. and have worked together since.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.motorauthority.com\/news\/1114390_bmw-partners-with-us-solid-state-battery-company\"> BMW began working with Solid Power<\/a> in 2017 to create solid-state batteries for high-performance EVs that could potentially lower costs by requiring less safety features than lithium-ion batteries.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to its partnership with Northvolt, VW is also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/autos-transportation\/volkswagen-seeks-partnerships-battery-materials-race-2021-06-15\/\">in talks with suppliers<\/a> to secure more direct access to supplies like semiconductors and lithium so it can keep its existing plants running at full speed.<\/p>\n<p>Now the rest of the industry is moving to work <em>with<\/em> battery companies, to share knowledge and resources and essentially become the manufacturer.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Battery joint ventures have become the

The company\u2019s attracted a lot of interest from investors, most recently raising a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/14\/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel\/\">$140 million Series E<\/a> that brought its total venture funding to $600 million.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The settlement is what\u2019s known as an \u201cassurance of voluntary compliance,\u201d and it\u2019s not an admission of guilt. <a href=\"https:\/\/oag.dc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2021-07\/Getaround-Inc.-DCOAG-Agreement-.pdf\">The settlement document<\/a> makes clear that Getaround denies it violated any consumer protection or tax laws.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KMj5ODFarp\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/14\/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel\/\">Getaround raises a $140 million Series E amid rebound in short-distance travel<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Getaround raises a $140 million Series E amid rebound in short-distance travel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/14\/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel\/embed\/#?secret=KMj5ODFarp\" data-secret=\"KMj5ODFarp\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>\u201cGig economy companies must abide by the same rules as their brick-and-mortar counterparts,\u201d Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement. \u201cThey must provide clear and accurate information to consumers, especially about the safety of their services, and they must pay their fair share of taxes like everyone else does.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The AG\u2019s office claims that Getaround operated without a license in the district, misrepresented its service and made \u201cuntrue or misleading representations\u201d about the safety of its car rental services. As part of the settlement, the company must create a written policy for user complaints regarding vehicle damage or theft, including a way for users to report any issues. It also must clearly disclose limitations of its safety features, such as its \u201cEnhanced Security\u201d software feature, which Getaround says on its website can immobilize your car when it\u2019s not being used. Getaround must also more clearly state the terms and conditions for insurance coverage.<\/p>\n<p>The AG\u2019s office also claimed that Getaround misled consumers by creating fake owner profiles for vehicles that it owned and operated. The company must now disclose its fleet cars clearly in listings.<\/p>\n<p>A Getaround spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company \u201ccategorically disagrees\u201d with the AG\u2019s allegations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith regard to safety and security, as the attorney general acknowledges, as soon as Getaround was notified of security issues affecting certain cars in the District, the company took immediate corrective action,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs is its practice, Getaround will continue to compensate car owners who have filed valid claims for loss or damage. Finally, Getaround never disputed liability for the taxes it is paying pursuant to this settlement. Getaround will continue to pay applicable taxes to the District and in every jurisdiction in which it operates.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The company spokesperson went on to say that &#8220;while the attorney general is focused on scoring political points, Getaround remains focused on connecting safe, convenient and affordable cars with District residents who need them to live and work.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"uHqwOHXBju\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/19\/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility\/\">10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/19\/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility\/embed\/#?secret=uHqwOHXBju\" data-secret=\"uHqwOHXBju\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Getaround was fined nearly $1 million by the Washington, D.C.

But how do you know when you&#8217;ve reached that magic moment?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You have to consider three metrics: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/21\/these-simple-metrics-will-tell-you-if-your-startup-is-ready-to-scale\/\">gross churn rate, the magic number and gross margin<\/a>,&#8221;

Nahm writes. &#8220;But keep in mind that the magic number is a lagging indicator, and it may take you a few quarters to see a positive result.&#8221;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Full Extra Crunch articles are only available to members.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/\">Use discount code <strong>ECFriday<\/strong><\/a> to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription.<\/i><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>If you are methodical in your approach to building a larger customer base, it is not difficult to foster steady growth.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers who shift with whichever way the wind is blowing \u2014 or blindly follow someone else&#8217;s idea of best practices \u2014 are less likely to be successful.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The not-so-secret secret here is that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/23\/susan-su-on-how-to-approach-growth-as-your-startup-raises-each-round\/\">the key to great retention is really simple<\/a>,&#8221;

But even if you understand that most of the work is done in advance, you should still prepare yourself for some sleepless nights after the launch date. The usual startup mantra will apply to your crowdfunding campaign just as well: Measure, analyze and adjust along the way.<\/p>\n<p>As you may know, crowdfunding fits some B2C products better than it does others. So to give you our product context here, <a href=\"https:\/\/memoryos.com\/\">memoryOS<\/a> is a gamified app that teaches memorization skills with the help of virtual <a href=\"https:\/\/memoryos.com\/mind-palace-virtual-implant\">mind palaces<\/a> and interactive microlessons taught by our co-founder, two-time World Memory Champion, Jonas von Essen.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2181625\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2181625\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2181625\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/memoryOS.jpg\" alt=\"a user holding a mobile device while using the memoryOS app\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/memoryOS.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/memoryOS.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/memoryOS.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/memoryOS.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/memoryOS.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/memoryOS.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/memoryOS.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2181625\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/memoryos.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">memoryOS <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Before becoming the most funded app on Kickstarter and getting it 6,400% funded (and carrying it further to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiegogo.com\/projects\/memoryos-greatly-improve-your-memory-the-fun-way#\/\">Indiegogo<\/a> platform right after), we spent countless hours researching down the rabbit hole of crowdfunding tips and tricks. We also had calls with several top-tier crowdfunding project creators who were kind enough to answer our questions and share bits of knowledge from their experience.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re sharing our approach (and secrets) to building a successful crowdfunding campaign because we know just how tough it can be to launch your own product. So here is a complete 10-step guide:<\/p>\n<h2>Find a unique idea<\/h2>\n<p>You should have a unique idea for a product that would solve at least one problem for your target audience. The proven approach is to set two major hypotheses right at the start and then work on getting them tested:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Does your product work and solve the problem as intended, and is it better than what\u2019s out there? This is usually referred to as the &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; stage.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Are there enough people who are willing to pay for your product for you to build a sustainable business?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You will need to build a base prototype to test the first hypothesis and, if it works, you can then work on turning it into an MVP or a short demo version for your future commercial product. You can then get people to test it for free and prepay for the full version.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tGetting people to actually back their interest with their wallet means you already have customers, not merely enthusiasts, and it significantly increases the chances of a successful project.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<br \/>\nYes, it\u2019s important that you get people to pay a minimum reservation deposit at this point and receive their commitment to pay the remaining amount for the full product later on. Getting people to actually back their interest with their wallet means you already have customers, not merely enthusiasts, and it significantly increases the chances of a successful project.<\/p>\n<h2>Get user feedback<\/h2>\n<p>As soon as you have something to test, conduct short surveys to better understand your customers by gathering and analyzing the reasons why and for what purpose(s) they would want your product.<\/p>\n<p>Here at memoryOS, we called the first couple thousand of our leads and had many insightful conversations to help us connect to our audience on a more personal and emotional level.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have a demo or prototype for the users to test, make sure to add a feedback form right at the end of their experience (or gather feedback using Google Forms for surveys, or via email inquiries).<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;re sharing our approach and secrets to building a

But the small overlap in that Venn diagram may be getting bigger. Last month at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/WWDC-2021\/\">WWDC<\/a>, Apple unveiled a free <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/08\/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists\/\">update for Apple Music subscribers<\/a> that added lossless audio streaming and spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos. Now, Android users can access these features too.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/05\/google-play-music-to-shut-down-starting-in-september-will-disappear-by-december\/\">shut down<\/a> its Google Play Music app (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/11\/rip-google-music-one-of-the-companys-last-examples-of-generosity\/\">RIP<\/a>) with the intent for users to migrate to YouTube Music. Some longtime Android fans are still unpleased about that decision and don&#8217;t feel that YouTube Music is up to par &#8212; but for audiophiles, these Apple Music updates might be what it takes to get them to switch. However, not all Android devices <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/7\/23\/22590148\/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-lossless-android\">support Atmos yet<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Apple Music isn&#8217;t the only streaming platform ramping up its audio quality. On the same day that Apple announced its upgraded audio features at WWDC, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/17\/amazon-makes-its-its-lossless-music-streaming-service-a-free-upgrade\/\">Amazon Music<\/a> also announced that it would support lossless streaming and spatial audio with Atmos functionality. Like Apple, Amazon offers these enhancements at no extra cost for subscribers. Spotify plans to launch a lossless audio feature as well, called <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/22\/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi\/\">HiFi<\/a>, but it will be a premium add-on, rather than a free upgrade like Apple Music or Amazon Music. YouTube Music doesn&#8217;t yet offer a comparable feature.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Currently, Spotify leads the streaming industry with <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.spotify.com\/2021-04-28\/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2021-earnings\/\">158 million paid subscribers<\/a>. For comparison, Apple Music had <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/27\/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers\/\">60 million subscribers<\/a> in June 2019, and Amazon Music had <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/22\/amazon-music-passes-55m-customers-across-its-free-and-paid-tiers-but-still-lags-behind-spotify-and-apple\/\">55 million<\/a>\u00a0in January 2020, but both companies haven&#8217;t shared updated numbers since then; YouTube Music has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/07\/youtube-premium-subscribers-get-a-new-perk-with-launch-of-testing-program\/\">at least 20 million<\/a> paid users.

partners explain how deep tech startups can fundraise successfully"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Startups developing so-called<\/span> deep tech often find it challenging to raise capital for various reasons. At TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising, two experienced investors spoke on the subject and advised startups facing a challenging fundraising path.<\/p>\n<p>Pae Wu and Garrett Winther are both partners at SOSV and run the fund&#8217;s programs around biotech and hardware. SOSV doesn&#8217;t shy away from startups building complex technology, and because of this, Wu and Winther are well placed to advise on fundraising. They presented three key points targeting startups fundraising for deep tech applications, but the points are applicable to startups of any variety.<\/p>\n<p>Before giving advice, the two acknowledged the nuances across the deep tech ecosystem and each industry. Their presentation is focused on general guidance applicable to nearly every startup.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding the right investor<\/h2>\n<p>The first point on Wu and Winther&#8217;s presentation sounds a bit self-serving but is based on solid advice. When building a deep tech startup, find the right investor, they said. This is general advice for startups, but according to these two, it&#8217;s even more important when building a company that might take longer for the investor to see a return.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In deep tech, it&#8217;s essential to think about founder-investor fit. And what we mean by this is understanding why an investor is even in VC in the first place. And what it is that&#8217;s driving you, the founder, to do what you do.<\/p>\n<p>And so we look at this fit as a Venn diagram between founders who have a near maniacal devotion to wanting to solve a core systemic problem and investors that thrive on the unique risk profile that comes in deep tech. Because with deep tech, we&#8217;re talking about both technical risk, where maybe that insight that is core to the company merely proves that we&#8217;re no longer having to break any laws of physics to do whatever it is you&#8217;re trying to do. So there&#8217;s a big technical risk. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 6:09)<\/strong><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tWe, as investors, love to see methodical founders who can see the first step that will converge at the right moment of technical and business milestones.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<h2>Set obtainable goals<\/h2>\n<p>Breakthrough technology hardly came from sudden breakthroughs.

Maker aircraft.<\/p>\n<p>A full written opinion has not yet been published.

It\u2019s an extraordinary request and it makes sense that Orrick would need to see more certain evidence of misappropriation.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cThere are some arguable indications of misappropriation, but given how equivocal the evidence is, Wisk is not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of an injunction,\u201d Orrick said in the tentative ruling. \u201cBecause the merits are so uncertain, Wisk has also not adequately shown irreparable injury based on misappropriation. And the balance of hardships favors Archer because, without solid evidence of misappropriation, an injunction would gravely threaten its business.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"JSxuCoGxSi\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft\/\">Wisk Aero sues Archer Aviation for alleged patent infringement, trade secret theft<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Wisk Aero sues Archer Aviation for alleged patent infringement, trade secret theft&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft\/embed\/#?secret=JSxuCoGxSi\" data-secret=\"JSxuCoGxSi\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Wisk says the judge\u2019s decision on the injunction has no bearing on the outcome of the case \u201cand does not exonerate Archer in the least.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe brought this lawsuit based on strong indications of theft and use of Wisk\u2019s IP, and the initial limited evidence gathered through the court process to date only confirms our belief that Archer\u2019s misappropriation of Wisk\u2019s trade secrets is widespread and pervades Archer\u2019s aircraft development,\u201d Wisk continued. \u201cFollowing today\u2019s ruling, Wisk will be allowed to begin collecting evidence in earnest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wisk was established in 2019 as a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, but its history with electric aviation stretches back much further. The company was originally founded in 2010 as Levt, which eventually merged with sister company Kitty Hawk. Wisk says it (as Kitty Hawk) zeroed in on a fixed-wing, 12-rotor design in 2016. It\u2019s this design that\u2019s the centerpiece of its debut aircraft, Cora.<\/p>\n<p>Archer, by contrast, is newer to the field. Much of Wisk\u2019s original complaint, filed in April, is predicated on the speed with which Archer is bringing its air taxi service to market. Archer also recruited many former Wisk engineers &#8212; including former employee Jing Xue, whom Wisk says downloaded nearly 5,000 files before his departure from the company, which it alleges he handed over to Archer.<\/p>\n<p>When he was cross-examined, Xue pled the Fifth Amendment, invoking his right to not self-incriminate, citing an ongoing federal investigation.<\/p>\n<p>Archer says Wisk has not brought forward any substantive evidence of the central claim of the lawsuit: that Archer received and used Wisk trade secrets. Wisk\u2019s allegations are based on \u201cconspiracy theories and outright misrepresentations,\u201d Archer\u2019s Deputy General Counsel Eric Lentell said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is clear to us from Wisk\u2019s actions in this case that after recognizing Archer&#8217;s momentum and pace of innovation, Wisk began abusing the judicial and criminal justice system in an attempt to slow us down to compensate for its own lack of success,\u201d Archer co-founders Brett Adcock and Adam Goldstein said.<\/p>\n<p>The court will hold a scheduling conference on August 11, where the judge will outline next steps for the case. A date for the trial has not been set.<\/p>\n<p>The case is filed in the California Northern District Court under case no. 3:2021cv02450.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YGxJkPKMux\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/11\/the-air-taxi-market-prepares-to-take-flight\/\">The air taxi market prepares to take flight<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The air taxi market prepares to take flight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/11\/the-air-taxi-market-prepares-to-take-flight\/embed\/#?secret=YGxJkPKMux\" data-secret=\"YGxJkPKMux\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Electric aviation startup Wisk Aero\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction against rival Archer Aviation was denied by a federal judge Thursday, the latest in an ongoing legal battle over whether Archer stole trade secrets in developing its flagship Maker aircraft.

Hyundai, which also sources batteries from LG Chem like GM, ended up replacing more than 75,000 batteries for its Kona EV.<\/p>\n<p>While it may sound alarming \u2014 GM&#8217;s recalls were triggered by five Bolt fires between 2017 and 2019 \u2014 it&#8217;s worth noting that gas cars typically cause around 150 fires a day, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usfa.fema.gov\/downloads\/pdf\/statistics\/v19i2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-ylk=\"elm:context_link;itc:0\" data-rapid_p=\"20\" data-v9y=\"1\">according to a FEMA report<\/a>.

At yesterday&#8217;s Q2 earnings call, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel announced that the platform grew both revenue and daily active users at the highest rates it has achieved in the last four years. Snapchat now has 293 million daily active users, growing 23% since last year.<\/p>\n<p>Snap went public in 2017 with a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/01\/snap-values-itself-at-nearly-24b-with-its-ipo-pricing\/?_ga=2.25886137.566122237.1626654100-1532633466.1621860309\">$24 billion valuation<\/a>, but not long before then, the ephemeral photo sharing app experienced a massive hiccup: Instagram cloned their then-unique Stories feature. After Instagram Stories launched, Snapchat&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/02\/02\/slowchat\/\">growth slowed<\/a> by 82%. Then, when Snapchat redesigned its app&#8217;s interface, Kylie Jenner <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/22\/snap-stock-sinks-as-kylie-jenner-says-she-doesnt-use-snapchat-anymore\/\">tweeted<\/a> that she didn&#8217;t use the app anymore, causing the company&#8217;s valuation to <a href=\"https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/22\/technology\/snapchat-update-kylie-jenner\/index.html\">drop by $1.2 billion<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore?

Its revenue reached an all-time high of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210204006019\/en\/Snap-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results\">$911 million<\/a> in Q4 of 2020, then went down to <a href=\"https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/442043304\/files\/doc_financials\/2021\/q1\/Q1%E2%80%9921-Earnings-Release-Final.pdf\">$770 million<\/a> the following quarter. Now, Snapchat&#8217;s revenue in Q2 of 2021 surpasses its previous high to reach <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210722005939\/en\/Snap-Inc.-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results\">$982 million<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The app&#8217;s Q2 growth could be attributed to the return of advertisers who scaled back their spending during the height of the pandemic, as well as the retention of users that flocked to the app while in lockdown. Like many social media platforms, Snapchat <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/tech\/mobile\/snap-grows-revenue-and-users-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\/\">grew its revenue and user base<\/a> during the pandemic, but this isn&#8217;t just a matter of re-engaging users with an app that they grew out of. As TikTok exploded on the scene and the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/06\/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more\/\">creator economy<\/a> boomed, Snapchat kept up by creating <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/23\/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators\/\">Spotlight<\/a>, a TikTok clone, and investing in the applications of augmented reality.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We made significant progress with our augmented reality platform this quarter,&#8221; Spiegel said. &#8220;More than 200 million Snapchatters engage with AR every day on average, and over 200,000 creators use Lens Studio to build AR Lenses for our community.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Last month, Snapchat went viral for its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/14\/everyone-you-know-is-a-disney-princess-which-means-ar-is-queen\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">Cartoon 3D Style Lens<\/a>, which makes you look like a character in a Pixar movie. Spiegel specifically mentioned this lens as a feature that &#8220;highlighted the power of Lenses to go viral both inside and outside of Snapchat.&#8221; But beyond fun face filters, Snapchat has been using AR to woo e-commerce partners. The app has developed AR experiences for Walt Disney World, Smile Direct Club, Zenni Optical, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Ralph Lauren and more. This includes try-on capabilities for watches, jewelry, eyewear, handbags, makeup and even clothing. At its Partner Summit in May, Snapchat revealed an update that lets users <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms\/\">scan friends&#8217; outfits<\/a> to find shopping recommendations for similar styles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a lot more work ahead to build out our technology and increase AR adoption, but we are thrilled with the results that our partners are seeing as we invest in our long-term camera opportunity,&#8221; said Jeremi Gorman, Snap&#8217;s chief business officer. &#8220;We are confident in our long-term opportunity, and are excited to double down on shopping and commerce via augmented reality.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In March, Snap acquired <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/17\/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics\/\">Fit Analytics<\/a>, a Berlin-based startup that helps shoppers find the right-sized apparel and footwear when shopping online. Combined with Snap&#8217;s investment in AR, could we eventually use AR to see which size of clothing to order? The application of that sort of technology would need to be handled sensitively, especially as the rates of eating disorders in teens are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/eating-disorders-surged-among-adolescents-in-pandemic-11624302000\">on the rise<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond e-commerce, Snapchat has sought out strategic partnerships with entertainment companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/20\/hbo-max-to-stream-free-episodes-inside-snapchat-for-co-watching-with-friends\/\">HBO Max<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/24\/snap-makes-a-deal-with-universal-music-group-adding-its-catalog-to-sounds\/\">Universal Music Group<\/a> and doubled down on its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/snap-announces-its-latest-generation-of-its-spectacles-a-streamlined-device-for-experience-the-world-in-ar\/\">Spectacles<\/a>, glasses that create AR experiences. Of course, Facebook is working on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/16\/facebook-ar-glasses-2021\/\">AR glasses <\/a>too. But for both companies, Snap&#8217;s recent successes show the rising adoption and value of AR experiences.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gpAskRmsfZ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms\/\">Snap emphasizes commerce in updates to its camera and AR platforms<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Snap emphasizes commerce in updates to its camera and AR platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms\/embed\/#?secret=gpAskRmsfZ\" data-secret=\"gpAskRmsfZ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6DJVu7epdU\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/12\/will-apple-facebook-or-microsoft-be-the-future-of-augmented-reality\/\">Will Apple, Facebook or Microsoft be the future of augmented reality?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Will Apple, Facebook or Microsoft be the future of augmented reality?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/12\/will-apple-facebook-or-microsoft-be-the-future-of-augmented-reality\/embed\/#?secret=6DJVu7epdU\" data-secret=\"6DJVu7epdU\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve started using Snapchat more regularly this year, you&#8217;re not alone.
